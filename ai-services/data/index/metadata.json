Under the Köppen climate \nclassification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above \nsea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop \nto 9 °C (48 °F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when \ntemperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature \nfor this period is 24 °C (75 °F).[45] Actual temperature ranges from a low of 10 degrees to a high \nof 29 degrees Centigrade.",

It is home to about 100 species of mammals, 527 bird species and a variety of plant \nspecies. The existence of Nairobi National Park has been of prestigious value as the only park \nwithin a city. The Park is covered by a highland of forest hardwoods. Variety of birds and animals \nfind their home in the Park including the Big Five. \nTo the North west of the city, adjacent to the Rift Valley is an area of undulating grassland with a \ncovering of rich well- drained “red- coffee soils”.  To the North- East of the city, the high and ever \nsloping land is dissected by South- East flowing streams which have formed a series of steep sided \nparallel ridges and valleys. South and East of Nairobi are grassland plains of poorly drained “black \ncotton clays”.Due to high population growth and urbanisation rates, environmental degradation \nhas been experienced in Nairobi, causing stress on the natural resources.  The main surface water \nsources are Ngong and Nairobi Rivers, clean when they enter the city but highly polluted as they \nleave. All rivers in Nairobi have been excavated in search of sand for construction.",

This result from a decline in a county‘s mortality and fertility rates while the \nproportion of working age rises. Having a low dependency ratio frees up resources for households \nand governments which they can invest in education, health, and well-being to help foster \neconomic growth. With reducing dependency ratio occasioned by reducing fertility rate and \nincreasing labour force, we project to record increased productivity. Further, in the medium term, \nthe County shall pursue a sustainable population policy, ensuring that we enhance our human \ncapital development for productivity. Kenya as a country endeavor to harness the potential of its \nyouthful population in driving the country towards the aspirations of Vision 2030. The country‘s \ndemographic dividend roadmap borrows its pillars from the African Union roadmap. The pillars \nare; a) Health and wellbeing b) Education and skills development c) Employment and \nentrepreneurship d) Rights, governance, and youth empowerment To harness the potential of its \nyouth in preparation for the demographic dividend window the county continues to invest in the \naforementioned areas as illustrated herein.

Physical infrastructure however \nremains temporal, as the Assembly has been accommodated within the same premises with \nthe County Executive. The inadequate space has not only provided limited accommodation \nof Members and Staff of the County Assembly in their working environment but also has a \nbig implication on the independence of the County Legislature in offering oversight to the \nCounty Executive. \nIn addressing the Representation role of the County Assembly, the last five years have not \nbeen satisfactory in meeting this need. The County Assembly has been hiring Ward Offices \nfor the Members. This was a stopgap measure whose cost is not sustainable. In addition, \nNominated Members of the County Assembly have never had offices to operate from. This \nhas stifled their effective representation of the special interests, which they represent in the \nAssembly. \nInformation Communications Technology is a key driver of any enterprise. The ICT \ninfrastructure that the County Assembly has been operating under is quickly becoming \nobsolete due to the volatility of the industry.

The M&E processes, methods and tools should be guided by Section 232 of the \nConstitution and all the legal provisions that provide for M&E, County M&E Policy in line with \nthe National M&E Policy, CIMES Guidelines, Kenya Norms and Standards for M&E and Kenya \nEvaluation Guidelines. The chapter highlights the proposed M&E structure; data collection, \nanalysis, reporting and learning; M&E outcome indicators tracking; and dissemination and \nfeedback mechanism.  \n6.2 County Monitoring and Evaluation Structure  \nThe Monitorng and evaluation unit shall be the lead institution in tracking implementation of this \nplan. A monitroring committee at the County executive committee will be the apex of monitoring \nprocess, and each sector will have a sectorial M&E committee. During the implementation phase \nof this plan, all stake holders will be part of the M&E institution for transparency and \naccountability. Project implementation units will be formed at the ward, Sub County and Sector \nlevels and will be key in monitoring and eavaluation of projects \n6.4 M&E Outcome Indicators  \nThis section presents programme outcome indicators.

The Clause also prescribes \noffences related to non-compliance to the provision. Clause 19 provides for \nthe specifications of waste containers. Clause 20 provides for the coding of \nwaste containers with their respective colours signifying which waste is \nsupposed to be disposed in the containers. Clause 22 requires every owner \nor occupier of a building to provide appropriate waste containers as \nprovided for by the proposed law. Clause 23 provides for the requirements of \nany person/firm must fulfil prior to the collection of waste. Clause 24 \nprohibits willful destruction of waste containers and further provides \nremedial measures in the event a person destroys the waste containers. \nClause 25 requires separation of waste by waste generators for convenient \ndisposal.",
